        <h2>Sharing a Copy of Your Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">The game isn't nearly finished, but it's finished <em>enough</em>. <strong>On this page,</strong> you will share your project, with your partner and with friends who have smartphones.</div>
        <h3>Create a link to share your app.</h3>

                <li>Select the project you want to share from the project list (your current project is likely named "U1L1-ClickAlonzo").</li>
                <div class="endnote">To locate a file, you can type in the search bar at the top to see only a list of matching files (see the example on the right, where only "U1" files are shown).</div>
                <li>Click "Share," and then click "Yes" to share. Then click "Cancel" to close the menu.</li>
                <li>Now, the URL (the link) at the top of the browser window has changed.  Copy the new URL, and email it to yourself. When you have time, you can send it to someone else to share the project.</li>

        <h3>Load and Save a Copy of a Shared Project </h3>
        We are working in pairs/triples so we need to make sure both members have access to the code. Note that driver and navigator should have just switched!!
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <h4><strong>Saving a Copy of a Project</strong></h4>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Login to account.</li>
                <li>Open shared project via a shared link</li>
                <li>Save the project into your account to make a copy.</li>
              <div class="endnote">When you open a shared link, you get a copy&mdash;not a shared file. So, if sharer changes the project their account, it will not change in your account; you will need to save it to your account again to have the change. Vice-versa, any changes you make to your copy do not show up in the sharer's saved copy.</div>
