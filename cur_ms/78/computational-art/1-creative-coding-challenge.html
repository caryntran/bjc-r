            This guide accompanies creative coding challenges 1, 2, and 3.

				<li>
                    <strong>Solid rectangles.</strong>  Make and run this script:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/flat.png" alt="" title="" /><br />
                    The light blue <code>set</code> block is in the Sensing palette, where it looks like <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/vid-cap.png" alt="" title="" />.  Just click once in the hexagonal slot to get True (the green check box).  If you're not sure what difference the "flat line ends" makes, try clicking the hexagonal slot again to run the script with that option False.  And of course you can change all the numbers, or have your program pick random numbers.
				</li>

				<li>
                    <strong>Color families.</strong>  Click the file menu icon and select "Libraries..."  Then, find the "Provide 100 selected colors" library and click "Import."<br />

                    In the Pen menu you'll find the <code>set pen to crayon</code> block.  Computers can display billions of colors, but unless you have to match the paint on your wall very precisely, finding your way through all those colors may be more trouble than it's worth.  The crayon library, just like a box of crayons, gives you a small set of vibrant colors, arranged in families.  So if you want a lot of browns in your picture, you could pick a random number between 30 and 39.<br />

				<li>At the right is a painting by Kazimir Malevich.  Its elements are rectangles, either horizontal or at a 45-degree angle, plus or minus a few degrees.  You can position rectangles randomly.  Your picture doesn't have to look like his&mdash;you're the artist!

							<span>Alphie:</span> If we just put rectangles in randomly, the tiny square dots will often be covered by larger ones.  Maybe we should do big ones first and smaller ones later.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Gamal:</span> I know ours don't have to look like the original, but I really like that huge black horizontal rectangle.  It gives the painting a structure, with a top part and a bottom part, even though it doesn't go all the way across.  I want to make sure to have one like that.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> I bet we can use the idea of drawing really thick lines <em>without</em> using <code>flat line ends</code> and get interesting results:

				<li>
				At the right is a painting by Theo van Doesburg.  It has some things in common with the Malevich picture, mainly the use of rectangles as the design elements.  But there are no 45-degree rectangles; instead, the constraint is that rectangles may not overlap, so if you want to place a random rectangle in the picture, each end may have to be shortened to avoid collisions.  You can use <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/blackp.png" alt="" title="" /> to find out if the point behind the sprite's rotation center is black.

                <li>
                At the right is a painting by Piet Mondrian. It has the constraint that the rectangles must tile together and be outlined in black. The pattern is much less random so consider placing individual rectangles nonrandomly.
