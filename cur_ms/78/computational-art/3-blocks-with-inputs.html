    <h2>Blocks with Inputs</h2>
    <div class="learn">
        <p><strong>On this page,</strong> you will use inputs to allow one block to do many things.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On the previous page you used blocks <code>asterisk</code> and <code>pinwheel</code> that we wrote for you, each
        with an input for the number of spokes. Now you're going to learn how to create your own blocks with inputs.</p>

    <p>The scripts are essentially all the same; only some of the <em>input values</em> change. Instead of having many
        separate scripts, you can make one general block <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/pinwheel-block.png"
            height="40" alt="pinwheel, branches:()" title="pinwheel, branches:()"> that will draw <em>all</em> such
        designs. The block has to work for a variety of inputs.</p>

        <p><strong>What kind of data can be an input?</strong> All kinds of data. In this example, the input is supposed
            to be a number, but <em>any</em> kind of value can be used as an input. For instance, you've seen the
            <code>list</code> block called with text as inputs. In Snap<em>!</em>, any kind of data can be used as an
            input, can be reported by a block, or can be put in a list.</p>


        <div class="vocabFullWidth">: What's an input? <strong>Parameter</strong> vs. <strong>Argument</strong>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <strong>parameter</strong> (or <em>formal parameter</em>) is the input <em>name,</em> such as
                    <var>number of branches</var>. The input name is set in the block definition. It never
                    changes.<br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    An <strong>argument</strong> (or <em>actual argument</em>) is the input <em>value,</em> such as 6
                    for a
                    hexagonal pinwheel. The input value is given each time the block is run; it can be a different value
                    each time.<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/example-argument.png"

                </li>
            </ul>
            We use the word "input" both for parameters (input names) and for arguments (input values).

    <p>Originally, you made five copies of the pinwheel script to create five slightly different pinwheels. Now, you've
        made a single procedure that includes the shared features of these five scripts and uses a parameter to handle
        the differences.</p>

            <h4><strong>Debugging Tip: Commenting Your Code</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Adding comments to your code may help you remember what your code does, helps other people reading
                your code to understand it, and can help you avoid bugs by increasing the clarity of your program.
                But it won't do any of those things if you comment every line of code, so each comment just says how
                a block inside your script works. You can add comments to your Snap<em>!</em> code by right-clicking
                (or control-clicking) in the Scripts area and choosing "add comment." <a href="#hint-comments"
                    data-toggle="collapse" title="Click for an animation that shows how to add comments.">Click for
                    an animation that shows how.</a>
            <div id="hint-comments" class="collapse">
                <img class="indent" data-gifffer="/bjc-r/img/2-complexity/Debugging/commenting.gif"
                    alt="Animation on how to  add a comment to a block and how a comment added to a hat block becomes that custom block's help message."
                    title="Animation on how to add a comment to a block and how a comment added to a hat block becomes that custom block's help message." />
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>You can attach a comment <em>to the hat block</em> in the Block Editor to create a help message for
                your block. This is the <em>best</em> way to comment, because people can find out what your block
                does without having to look inside, just like the help messages for primitive blocks.</p>

            <p>Part of the reason some people emphasize the importance of detailed comments is that they are
                programming in text languages, which discourage long variable and procedure names. (Typically, you
                can't include spaces in the names, and you have to type the entire name every time you use that
                variable or procedure.) So you see names like <code>substLcUc</code> instead of
                <code>substitute lower case letters for capital letters in string</code>. If a program is full of
                drastically abbreviated names for procedures and variables, it's no surprise if the code needs
                documentation. In Snap<em>!,</em> the names in the program can be self-documenting.</p>

    <h4>More About Program Documentation</h4>

    <p>Commenting is only one form of documentation. It's not the <em>best</em> form, because attaching a comment to a
        particular place in the program documents only that one procedure or code segment, and doesn't explain how
        different sections of the program interact. But commenting is an easy way to document small details.</p>
    <p>Documentation can be <em>external</em> (written for users of the program) or <em>internal</em> (written for
        yourself or other developers of the program). Both kinds are important, if it's a program people other than the
        author are going to use. Usually they should be separate documents&mdash;another reason why comments aren't the
        best form of documentation.</p>
    <p>If you're writing a program by yourself, internal documentation may seem silly. "I know how my own program
        works." But if the program will still be in use a year later, it will probably need maintenance, and you may
        well have forgotten the details of its implementation. In a programming class like this one, most of the
        programs you write are very small, and you can understand them at a glance. But real programs are generally much
        bigger than lab exercises designed to take less than an hour of work.</p>
    <p>It's best if the first attempt at documentation is made even before starting to code. The documentation will
        specify the desired program behavior (external) and the intended program structure (internal). These documents
        can be used in testing the code to ensure that it behaves as planned.</p>
