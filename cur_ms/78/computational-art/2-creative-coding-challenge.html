						<div>
							<span>Gamal:</span> It looks like a map.  Houses on the left, the town center on the right, with City Hall and the fire station and the mall.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> Maybe.  To me the part on the left looks a little like a fingerprint, and the part on the right is clearly a person facing right, with her nose up against the right edge, halfway down.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Alphie:</span> Never mind what it looks like.  How are <em>we</em> going to make something that looks <em>like it?</em>
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> Parts of it look like curved, thick dotted lines.  We could do something like this:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/betty-code.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/betty-line.png"><br />
							But I'm not sure how to get a bunch of those to fit together.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Alphie:</span> Randomness is your friend.  Let's make a bunch of your lines, all different, and just point them in different directions.<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alphie-dotted.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alphie-lines.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alphie-pic.png">
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> Wow!  That's very cool.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Alphie:</span> Nothing like what it's supposed to look like, though.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> What do you mean, "supposed"?  Go read the boldface line up above this blue box again.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Alphie:</span> Yeah, I know, but "take liberties" doesn't mean "take whatever happens on your first try."  I have another idea.  We've been thinking of Thomas's picture as brown boxes on a white background, but it's actually more brown than white.  What if we start with a brown background and draw white lines on it?
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Gamal:</span> What about that town center on the right?
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> It's not a map.  But to make you happy, when drawing white lines over toward the right, we can make them thicker, so the right part will have more white space than the left part.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Alphie:</span> Uh oh... If you look carefully at the original picture, the brown boxes aren't all the same shade of brown.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Betsy:</span> Alphie, you worry too much.  But to make <em>you</em> happy, once we have the space divided into brown regions, we can <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/fill.png" alt="fill" title="fill"> some of them in different colors.
						</div>
						<div>
							<span>Gamal:</span> Hey! Gang! Remember we imported that crayon library?  Guess what!  There's a "World Map" library, too!  And it makes "watercolor" maps like this:<br />
							<img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/water.png" alt="vague map of a town" title="vague map of a town"><br />
							And then I went over every dot on the stage using <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/my-brightness.png" alt="(brightness) at (myself)" title="(brightness) at (myself)"> and <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/my-hue.png" alt="(hue) at (myself)" title="(hue) at (myself)"> to decide whether to make each dot white or brown:<br />
