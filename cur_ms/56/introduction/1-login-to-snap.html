				<li>
					Click the Cloud menu in the tool-bar.
                    <ul>
						<li><strong>If</strong> it says "Logout" and your user name, then you are already logged in.</li>
						<li><strong>If</strong> it says someone else's user name, then log them out and log in with your own user name.</li>
						<li><strong>Otherwise</strong>, choose "Login..." and enter your user name and password.</li>
                    </ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					You can quickly check if anyone is logged in by looking at the Cloud menu icon.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>If</strong> it is solid and filled in, someone is logged in.</li>
						<li><strong>If</strong> it is an outline of a cloud, no one is logged in.</li>
                    </ul>
