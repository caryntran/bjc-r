        <h3>Keeping Score</h3>
        <p>The player will also want to know how much progress they have made in the game. The command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/ghosteffect.png" alt="change (ghost) effect by ()" title="change (ghost) effect by ()" /> can control Alonzo's <em>transparency</em>.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth">
            <p>
                The <strong>transparency</strong> of an image is how much you can see what's behind it. For example, here is the Alonzo sprite shown with three different transparencies (which have been set using the <code>ghost effect</code> block).<br />
                <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/transparency2.png" title="three pictures of Alonzo, with ghost effect 0%, 25%, and 50%, on a background of a brick wall" alt="three pictures of Alonzo, with ghost effect 0%, 25%, and 50%, on a background of a brick wall" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <p>Use transparency to tell the user how close they are to winning: every time they click, Alonzo gets more invisible, and when he disappears completely, they win the game.</p>
            <ol start="3">
                <li> Drag the <code>change (ghost) effect</code> block into the center scripting area, and experiment with different input numbers (clicking it repeatedly after each change) to see exactly what it does.  At what ghost effect value does Alonzo become completely invisible?  You can use the command <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/clear-graphic-effects.png" alt="clear graphic effects"> to make Alonzo fully opaque again.</li>
                <li>Then, modify your script so that every time Alonzo is clicked, he gets a little more ghostly.  Think about how the input you use affects the length of the game. Try out your game.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
