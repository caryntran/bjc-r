        <h2>Giving the Player Feedback</h2>
        <div class="learn">Now the game is challenging, but players can't tell how well they're doing because Alonzo jumps around whether the player clicks him or not. <strong>On this page</strong>, you will create a way for the player of your game to know how well they are doing.</div>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Confirming Whether Alonzo Was Clicked</h3>
        <p>First, the person playing your game wants to know right away whether they succeeded at clicking Alonzo before he moved out of the way.</p>
        <div class="vocabFullWidth"><strong>: Sprites and Costumes</strong>
            <p>The Alonzo character is named after Alonzo Church, a major contributor to early computer science. In this project, there are three objects related to Alonzo:
                <ul>
                    <li>One is a <em><strong>sprite</strong></em>, which is like an actor on the stage who knows how to do many different things, such as walk around the stage and speak the lines of the play.</li>
                    <li>The other two are <em><strong>costumes</strong></em>,  picture that can be &quot;worn&quot; by a sprite.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            Program Alonzo to face the other way when clicked.
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo.png" alt="Alonzo character" title="Alonzo character" height="60">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-flipped-other-way.png" alt="Alonzo character flipped to face the other way" title="Alonzo character flipped to face the other way" height="60">
            <ol>
                <li>The project should have two Alonzo costumes&mdash;one facing right and the other facing left&mdash;so you can use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/next-costume.png" alt="next costume"> block to make the sprite face the other way.  Add the <code>next costume</code> block to the place in your program where the user has just clicked on Alonzo.</li>
                <li>Test your program. Make sure Alonzo faces the other way when he is clicked but not when he jumps without being clicked.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
