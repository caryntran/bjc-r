    <h3>Load and Save a Copy of a Shared Project </h3>
    We are working in pairs/triples so we need to make sure both members have access to the code. Note that driver and
    navigator should have just switched!!
    <div class="forYouToDo">
        <h4><strong>Saving a Copy of a Project</strong></h4>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Make sure you are logged into to your account.</li>
            <li>Open shared project via a shared link</li>
            <li>Save the project into your account to make a copy.
                <div class="narrower">
                    <h4><strong>Saving a Snap<em>!</em> Project</strong></h4>
                    <p>Choose "Save As" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, <img

                        Type in "[your name] Alonzo" (for example, "Anitha Alonzo"). And click "Save".</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <div class="endnote">When you open a shared link, you get a copy&mdash;not a shared file. So, if sharer
                changes the project their account, it will not change in your account; you will need to save it to your
                account again to have the change. Vice-versa, any changes you make to your copy do not show up in the
                sharer's saved copy.</div>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h3>Duplicate and edit Alonzo!</h3>
    We're going to make another Alonzo costume to use in our game!
    <div class="forYouToDo">
        <ol>
            <li>
                Go to the "Costumes" tab for your current sprite.

                    style='width: auto; height: "50%";' width='100px' height='200px' />
            </li>
            <li>
                Right click on Alonzo and click "duplicate"!

                <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/costumes-duplicate.png" alt="Costumes duplicate"
                    title="Costumes duplicate" style='width: auto; height: "50%";' width='100px' height='200px' />
            </li>
            <li>
                Right click on your newly duplicated Alonzo and click "edit"!

            </li>

            <li>
                A menu should open! Flip him horizonatally by clicking the side by side triangles <img

                and then add whatever other decorations you want to Alonzo!
            </li>
            <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" />
            </li>
            <li>Follow the same steps you did at the top of the page to create a shared link to this project, and then
                email the link to your partner. Triple check that when you click the link, it takes you to the right
                place!</li>
            <li>Both of you should submit this link as your exit ticket!</li>
