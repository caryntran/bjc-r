        <h2>Programming a Game</h2>
        <div class="learn">
    		<p><strong>On this page,</strong> you'll build a simple game in which the player tries to click a character that's jumping around.</p>

            You should be working with a partner. It's not just for students; professional programmers work with partners too.
            <p>You should ALWAYS be screensharing!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Get Ready!</h3>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol>
                <li>Remember, what is a <strong>driver</strong> and what is a <strong>navigator</strong>?</li>
                <li>Pick roles to start with. Note that you will switch multiple times in this lab. (If you have more three people in your group, you can have two navigators)</li>
                <li>The <strong>driver</strong> share their screen. The <strong>navigator</strong> should have lab instructions open.</li>
                <li>CHECK: Is the cloud filled in? If not, you should log in!</li>

                This is <em>Alonzo</em>, the mascot of our programming language, <em>Snap!</em>. You should see him on the <em>stage,</em> the white area in the top right corner of the Snap<em>!</em> window.
            </span>
        </div>
        <p style="clear:both;">
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/alonzo-on-stage.png" alt="picture of Snap! window with white rectangle at right labeled 'Stage' and yellow character on that stage labeled 'Sprite named Alonzo'" title="picture of Snap! window with white rectangle at right labeled 'Stage' and yellow character on that stage labeled 'Sprite named Alonzo'" />
        </p>
        <p>You're going to program a game in which the goal is to click on Alonzo as he's moving around.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="3">
                <li>
                    As a first step, make Alonzo jump someplace else on the stage when he's clicked. Drag these two blocks into the scripting area (the center area of the window):<br />

                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/when-clicked-jump.png" width="199" height="87" alt="when I am clicked, go to [random position]">

                    <p>This is a computer program, also known as <em>software</em>.  It's a very short one, but it'll get more interesting soon.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Test your program: Click on Alonzo several times. If your program works, Alonzo should move to a random position on the stage each time you click him.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="takeNote">
            <div class="takeNoteHeading"> Take Note (Share your sceen and read this together!) </div>
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-i-am-clicked.png" alt="when i am (clicked)" title="when i am (clicked)" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-green-flag-clicked-full-size.png" alt="when 'green flag' clicked" title="when 'green flag' clicked" />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/when-space-key-pressed.png" alt="when (space) key pressed" title="when (space) key pressed" />
            <p>Blocks that look like this can be used to detect an <strong>event</strong> such as clicking on the sprite, pressing a key, or clicking the green flag button (<img class="button" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/green-flag_button.png" alt="green-flag button" title="green-flag button"/>). They tell the script to start when that event occurs. Because these blocks can sit only on top of a script (as a way to start the script), Snap<em>!</em> programmers call them "hat blocks."  Using events to control a program is called <em><strong>event-driven programming</strong></em>.</p>
	        <p>Not every script needs a hat block; you can also run a script by clicking on it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
			<ol start="5">
                <li>Find <code>when I am (clicked)</code> and <code>when (space) key pressed</code> in the yellow Control palette, and see what other choices are in their drop-down menus.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

        <p>It's a good idea to <em>save</em> your project every so often.</p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="6">
                <li>
                    Choose "Save" from the Snap<em>!</em> File menu, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/file_button.png" alt="File button" title="File button"/>.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            The game isn't much fun if Alonzo just sits there waiting to be clicked.  Once you've clicked him, he should keep jumping around on his own. To make Alonzo keep moving around, you need a block that says "do this <code>forever</code>." And there is a block that does it:<br />
            <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever.png" alt="forever" title="forever" />
        </p>
        <div class="forYouToDo">
            <ol start="7">
                <li>
                    <div class="sidenoteBig">A bunch of blocks clicked together is called a <em>script</em>.</div>
                	Attach this to the bottom of your Alonzo script:<br />
                    <img class="indent" src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/forever-jump.png" alt="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" title="forever {
    go to (random position)
}" />
                    <div class="narrower">The sequence of blocks <em>inside</em> the <code>forever</code> block will repeat until you <strong>click the red stop sign</strong>, <img src="/bjc-r/img/1-introduction/stop_button.png" alt="red stop button" title="red stop button"/>, or stop the script in some other way.</div>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Alonzo moves too fast. Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/wait-1-secs.png" alt="wait 1 secs" title="wait 1 secs" /> block to slow him down. Try your program, and increase or reduce the wait time if you like.
                    <div class="endnote">
                        Where the <code>wait</code> block goes in your script matters. Do you want the script to wait one time or each time Alonzo moves?
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/icons/save-now.png" alt="Save your work" title="Save your work" /></li>

            </ol>
